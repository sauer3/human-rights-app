This repo contains the scripts to scrape human rights cases from the European court of human rights and then visualize them with an interactive shiny app (shown below). 

The code for scraping data from HUDOC is written with the intention of updating new cases for an already existing dataset.  

Some data is not provided due to space constraints. See readme file in data folder for how to get access.
